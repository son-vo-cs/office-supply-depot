Project description:

Office Supply Depot (OSD) is an online office retailer with 2 warehouses in San Jose. The warehouse doesnâ€™t have a 
showroom as all the items for sale are listed online. It has a pickup area for customer to pick up their prepaid orders made 
online.  It offers free delivery services for any orders over $100.00. For any orders that are less than 15lbs, the delivery 
will be done by a drone on the same day during business hours.  Otherwise the orders will be delivered by delivery truck 
within 2 business days.  For any order that are under $100, customer can request deliveries (drone or truck) by paying a 
surcharge of $20.  For same day truck delivery of orders over $100, customer can pay a surcharge of $25. 

Customer will be able to buy various office supply items by first placing them into a shopping cart before they check-out. The store 
managers are able to update the inventory using an administrator panel when new stock are being delivered to the 
warehouse from the suppliers.
